🛒 Console-Based E-Commerce Application (Core Java)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Project Overview
----------------------
The Console-Based E-Commerce Application is a Java project developed using core Java concepts. The application simulates a real-world online shopping system in a console environment. It allows users to browse products category-wise, view details, add items to a cart, and proceed to checkout with a simulated payment process.
This project is lightweight, simple to execute, and runs on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

🎯 Objectives
----------------
-> To design and develop a console-based shopping application using core Java.
-> To strengthen understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
-> To implement structured menu-driven program flow.
-> To manage products and cart functionality using arrays and objects.
-> To simulate a checkout and payment process.

🧠 Concepts Used
-------------------
-> This project demonstrates the practical use of:
-> Classes and Objects
-> Arrays of Objects
-> Encapsulation
-> Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
-> Loops (for, while)
-> Methods and Modular Programming
-> User Input Handling using Scanner
-> Basic Console Formatting

🏬 Features
-----------------
✔ Category-based product browsing (Electronics, Books, Fashion, etc.)
✔ Sub-category navigation
✔ Structured product display with details
✔ Add to Cart functionality
✔ Dynamic total price calculation
✔ Checkout and payment simulation
✔ Menu-driven interactive system
✔ Error handling for invalid inputs

🔄 Program Flow
----------------
-> The application starts with a main menu.
-> The user selects a product category.
-> Sub-categories and products are displayed.
-> The user selects a product ID to add to the cart.
-> The cart stores selected items and updates the total amount.
-> The user proceeds to checkout.
-> The payment module simulates transaction processing.

After successful payment, the cart is cleared.

The program continues until the user exits.
